# Contact Card Assignment

The purpose of this challenge is to create a responsive contact card using flexbox and/or grid. The card can be for you personally or for a fictitious character. In the previous exercises you were provided code to focus on semantic HTML, Flexbox, and Grid. In this exercise, it will be up to you to build the project.

The first deliverable will require you to think about the structure and content of your contact card by creating your own mockups. The mockups do not have to be incredibly detailed, but they should be clear enough to show that you have thought about the design. You must have at least two mockups, one for a small mobile device and one for a large mobile device/tablet. These will be stored in the "mockups" folder. **DO NOT** write any code before this deliverable. We will spend time during the next meeting discussing your mockups and any blockers regarding the task. I have included a simple mockup in the “mockups” folder and below
